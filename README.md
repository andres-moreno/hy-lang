Here you can find the slides and the Jupyter notebook I presented to
ClojureMN on 6/14/2017. There isn't much exciting here except perhaps
for the installation instructions using `conda`, Continuum's
package/environment manager for the Anaconda Python distribution.

Please note that the Jupyter notebook has `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and
`seaborn` as dependencies. We also need `python 3.5` or higher.
